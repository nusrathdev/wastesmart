# Storage Problem Solutions for WasteSmart App

## ðŸ”§ **Steps to Fix Storage Issues:**

### 1. **Firebase Storage Configuration**

#### A. Update Storage Rules in Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Your Project â†’ Storage â†’ Rules
2. Replace the rules with the content from `FIREBASE_STORAGE_RULES.txt`
3. Click "Publish"

#### B. Check Firebase Configuration:
1. Verify `google-services.json` is in the correct location (`app/` directory)
2. Ensure Firebase Storage is enabled in your project
3. Check if billing is enabled (required for uploads)

### 2. **Network & Connectivity Issues**

#### Check Internet Connection:
- App now validates network connectivity before upload
- Error message: "No internet connection. Please check your network and try again."

#### Solutions:
- Ensure device has stable internet connection
- Try switching between WiFi and mobile data
- Check firewall settings if on corporate network

### 3. **File Size & Format Issues**

#### Image Size Limits:
- **Maximum file size:** 5MB per image
- **Automatic compression:** Images are compressed to max 1024x1024 pixels
- **Supported formats:** JPEG, PNG

#### Error Messages:
- "Photo file is too large. Please use a smaller image (max 5MB)."
- "Selected image is too large. Please choose a smaller image (max 5MB)."

### 4. **Permission Issues**

#### Required Permissions:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_MEDIA_IMAGES" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
```

#### Runtime Permission Checks:
- Camera permission for photo capture
- Gallery permission for image selection (Android 13+)
- All permissions are requested automatically

### 5. **Firebase Authentication Issues**

#### User Authentication:
- User must be logged in to upload images
- Error message: "Please log in to submit a report"

#### Solutions:
- Ensure user is properly authenticated
- Check Firebase Auth configuration
- Verify user session hasn't expired

### 6. **Storage Path Issues**

#### Correct Storage Structure:
```
/waste_reports/
  /{userId}/
    /{timestamp}.jpg
```

#### File Naming Convention:
- Format: `yyyyMMdd_HHmmss.jpg`
- Example: `20250624_143022.jpg`

### 7. **Common Error Messages & Solutions**

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| "Object not exists" | File path issue or Firebase rules | Check Firebase Storage rules |
| "Photo file not found" | Camera capture failed | Retake photo, check camera permissions |
| "Error uploading image" | Network or Firebase issue | Check internet connection, Firebase config |
| "Firebase initialization error" | Config problem | Verify google-services.json file |
| "Cannot access selected image" | Gallery permission | Grant gallery permission |

### 8. **Debug Steps**

#### Enable Detailed Logging:
1. Check logcat with filter: `ReportWasteActivity`
2. Look for detailed error messages and file paths
3. Verify Firebase Storage upload progress

#### Test Network Connectivity:
```bash
# Test Firebase Storage access
curl -I https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com
```

#### Check File Permissions:
1. Verify app has storage permissions
2. Check if external storage is available
3. Ensure app-specific directory is writable

### 9. **Production Checklist**

#### Before Deployment:
- [ ] Firebase Storage rules configured
- [ ] Billing enabled for Firebase project
- [ ] Image compression working
- [ ] File size validation active
- [ ] Network connectivity checks in place
- [ ] Error handling for all upload scenarios
- [ ] User authentication working
- [ ] FileProvider properly configured

#### Performance Optimization:
- [ ] Image compression reduces file sizes
- [ ] Upload progress indicators working
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for failed uploads
- [ ] Offline storage for later upload (future enhancement)

### 10. **Testing Storage Functionality**

#### Test Cases:
1. **Camera Photo Upload:** Take photo â†’ Upload â†’ Verify in Firebase Storage
2. **Gallery Photo Upload:** Select image â†’ Upload â†’ Verify in Firebase Storage
3. **Large File Handling:** Try uploading >5MB image â†’ Should show error
4. **Network Issues:** Disable internet â†’ Try upload â†’ Should show error
5. **Authentication:** Logout â†’ Try upload â†’ Should prompt login

#### Firebase Console Verification:
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Storage
2. Navigate to `waste_reports/{userId}/`
3. Verify uploaded images appear with correct names
4. Check file sizes are reasonable (compressed)

## ðŸš€ **Expected Results After Fixes:**

âœ… Images upload successfully to Firebase Storage  
âœ… File size validation prevents oversized uploads  
âœ… Image compression reduces storage costs  
âœ… Network validation prevents wasted upload attempts  
âœ… Clear error messages guide users to solutions  
âœ… Proper authentication ensures security  
âœ… Detailed logging helps with debugging  

## ðŸ“ž **If Issues Persist:**

1. Check Firebase Console for detailed error logs
2. Verify Firebase project configuration
3. Test with different devices/network conditions
4. Review logcat output for specific error details
5. Ensure all dependencies are up to date
