## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important for Production:**
- These are default credentials for development/testing only
- In production, implement proper user management with secure passwords
- Consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use Firebase Authentication for production user management
- Implement password reset functionality
- Add two-factor authentication for admin accounts

## Firebase Integration

The system also supports Firebase Authentication alongside these default credentials:
- Firebase users will be authenticated through Firebase Auth
- Default credentials bypass Firebase for quick testing
- Both authentication methods lead to the same dashboard functionality

## Troubleshooting

If login fails:
1. Check that credentials are typed exactly as shown (case-sensitive)
2. Ensure internet connection for Firebase authentication
3. Check Firebase configuration if using Firebase Auth
4. Verify that the target dashboard activities exist and are properly configured

## Adding New Users

To add new default users:
1. Add credentials to the respective Activity files
2. Update the `isDefaultAdminCredential()` or `isDefaultCollectorCredential()` methods
3. Update this documentation file
4. Consider implementing a proper user management system for production
